# Prerequasits

FFmpeg			-----		https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ - release builds - ffmpeg-release-full.7z - 


# running the script
to run the downloader place it in a folder, open CMD navigate to sed folder type in 		python Youtube_to_MP3.py

# recommened quick launcher
I recommend making a quick start bat file and placing it on your desktop for ease of use.

the script looks something like this 

Echo off

cd\					<-- start by sending the script to the root directory

cd users				

cd user

cd OneDrive				<-- because windows is shit now.. 

cd Desktop

cd Youtbe_to_MP3			<-- this is the folder the bot is located in if there is spaces in the folder name use "" around the folder name if it has Spaces

python Youtube_to_MP3.py		<-- command to start the bot

pause					<-- this prevents the script from closing prematurely
